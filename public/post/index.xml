      <description>Have you ever found a GitHub repository with an interesting R package?  Probably yes. 
How cool would it be to try it out without having to deal with installation and dependencies?
Fortunately, it is possible thanks to the BinderHub - the server technology that turns computational material (e.g. Jupyter Notebook) into interactive computational environments in the cloud.
Here you can see an example of such interactive notebook.</description>

      <description>Even though work on Artificial Intelligence began in 1956 and the field didn’t really take off.
Well, it did, but not the way the founding fathers anticipated: the great success of AI was thanks to statistics, not formal logic.
During its development, AI has already gone through two periods known as AI winters (1974 - 1980 and 1987 - 1993). They were the result of not meeting the exaggerated expectations in fields like automatic translation and general AI (AGI).</description>
