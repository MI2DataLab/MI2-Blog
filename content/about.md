This blog is about areas of interests and research of members of [MI2 Group](http://mi2.mini.pw.edu.pl) at [Warsaw University of Technology](https://www.pw.edu.pl/engpw).
The head of MI2 Group is [prof. Przemys≈Çaw Biecek](http://biecek.pl). 
Currently, our work is focused on interpretable machine learning. We also cooperate with practitioners from other fields on projects related to genetics, medicine and education.



Our projects include 

* [DALEX: Descriptive mAchine Learning EXplanations](https://pbiecek.github.io/DALEX/) and a family of packages related to xAI:

  * [auditor - Model Verification, Validation, and Error Analysis](https://mi2datalab.github.io/auditor/),
  
  * [breakDown - Model Agnostic Explainers for Individual Predictions](https://pbiecek.github.io/breakDown/),
  
  * [ceterisParibus - Ceteris Paribus Plots (What-If plots) for explanations of a single observation ](https://pbiecek.github.io/ceterisParibus/),

  * [factorMerger - Set of Tools to Support Addaptive Post-Hoc Fusing of Groups](https://mi2datalab.github.io/factorMerger/),

  * [live - Local Interpretable (Model-agnostic) Visual Explanations](https://mi2datalab.github.io/live/),
  
  * [modelDown - Generating Reports About Model Explanations](https://mi2datalab.github.io/modelDown/),

  * [randomForestExplainer - Set of Tools to Understand What is Happening Inside a Random Forest](https://mi2datalab.github.io/randomForestExplainer/),
    
  * [survxai - Explainable Survival Analysis](https://mi2datalab.github.io/survxai/),

* [MLGenSig (Machine Learning Genetic Signatures) Methods of machine learning in construction of integrated genetic signatures](https://mi2datalab.github.io/MLGenSig_webpage/index.html),

* [RTCGA - the family of R packages containing TCGA data](http://rtcga.github.io/RTCGA/),

* [archivist - Set of Tools for Datasets and Plots Archiving](http://pbiecek.github.io/archivist/),
